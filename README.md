  <summary><h2>Product Description</h2></summary>

**Çıkmış**, üniversite öğrencilerinin sınav hazırlık süreçlerini daha verimli ve stratejik hale getirmek için geliştirilmiş, yapay zeka destekli yenilikçi bir web platformudur. Platform, öğrencilerin kendi üniversitelerinin, fakültelerinin ve bölümlerinin geçmiş yıllardaki vize ve final sorularına kolayca erişmesini sağlar.

Ancak "Çıkmış" sadece bir soru arşivi değildir. Yapay zeka motoru sayesinde, öğrencilerin performansını analiz eder, eksik oldukları konuları tespit eder, kişiselleştirilmiş örnek sınavlar üretir ve zorlandıkları sorular için anında, adım adım çözümler sunar. Amacımız, her öğrencinin kendi öğrenme hızına ve ihtiyaçlarına uygun, akıllı bir çalışma asistanına sahip olmasını sağlayarak akademik başarılarını en üst düzeye taşımaktır.

    <summary><h4>English explanation</h4></summary>

**Çıkmış** is an innovative, AI-powered web platform developed to make the exam preparation process for university students more efficient and strategic. The platform allows students to easily access past midterm and final exam questions from their own universities, faculties, and departments.

However, "Çıkmış" is more than just a question archive. Thanks to its artificial intelligence engine, it analyzes student performance, identifies areas of weakness, generates personalized sample exams, and provides instant, step-by-step solutions for challenging questions. Our goal is to empower every student with a smart study assistant tailored to their individual learning pace and needs, thereby maximizing their academic success.

  <summary><h1>Sprint 1</h1></summary>

This project is a **FastAPI-based backend service** designed to provide a platform for accessing past university exam questions. It allows users to filter exams based on university, department, class level, year, and semester, and then view the questions for a selected exam.

- **Sprint Review Participants:**
  * Busenur Şahin, Mehmet Can Derebağı, Mehmet Halit Barut, Ceren Yaşar, Sena Arslan

## 🚀 Features

  * **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login system.
  * **Dynamic Filtering**: Enables users to find exams with a multi-level filtering system (University -\> Department -\> Class).
  * **Exam and Question Retrieval**: Provides endpoints to fetch detailed information about exams and their corresponding questions.
  * **Scalable Architecture**: Built with a modular structure using FastAPI routers, making it easy to extend and maintain.
  * **ORM Integration**: Uses SQLAlchemy for seamless interaction with the database.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

  * **Backend**: FastAPI
  * **Database**: SQLite (with SQLAlchemy ORM)
  * **Authentication**: Passlib for password hashing, python-jose for JWT creation.
  * **Data Validation**: Pydantic
  * **API Testing**: Swagger UI and ReDoc (auto-generated by FastAPI)

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories and files:

```
├── main.py             # Main application file
├── database.py         # Database connection and session management
├── models.py           # SQLAlchemy database models
├── schemas.py          # Pydantic data validation schemas
├── crud.py             # Reusable functions for database operations
├── security.py         # Functions for password hashing and token management
├── config.py           # Application configuration settings
└── routers/
    ├── exams.py        # API endpoints for exams

  * **Local Database**: It has been decided to use **SQLite** as the local database for development and testing.

## 📝 Sprint Planning & Retrospective

### Sprint 1

  * **Expected Point Completion**: 

In Sprint 1, the target was set as 150 story points. This estimation was based on the foundational tasks required to set up the project infrastructure, such as:
	•	Setting up the FastAPI environment
	•	Designing the initial database schema
	•	Implementing basic authentication and authorization logic

The complexity and time requirements of these tasks were considered during the estimation process.

Upon the completion of Sprint 1, the actual completed story points will be evaluated. This will help us:
	•	Measure team velocity
	•	Identify potential over/underestimations
	•	Adjust future sprint goals accordingly

  * **Point Completion Logic**: The first sprint has a target of 150 points. Subsequent sprints will adjust based on the team's velocity and project needs.

  •	**Sprint 1:** 150 points
	•	**Sprint 2:** 200 points
	•	**Sprint 3:** 200 points

  * **Product Backlog :** Trello

### Sprint Review:

  * The initial project setup with FastAPI was completed successfully.
  * The database models and schemas for the core features (Users, Exams, Questions) have been defined.
  * A basic user authentication system (register and login) has been implemented and tested.
  * The main challenge was designing the multi-level filtering logic for the exams, which required careful planning of the database relationships and API endpoints.
  * We believe we had a productive sprint and established a solid foundation for the project.

### Sprint Retrospective:

  * For the next sprint, we will focus on implementing the remaining CRUD operations for exams and questions.
  * We plan to enhance the filtering capabilities and add more detailed information to the exam and question models.
  * It was decided to write comprehensive unit and integration tests for the existing endpoints to ensure stability.
  * We will also start working on the frontend integration, coordinating with the frontend team to align on the API specifications.
  * To improve brand recognition, we will brainstorm a project name and logo in the upcoming sprint.
